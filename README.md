# CNART
Campus Network Automatic Reconnection Tool

Ref: https://blog.alx962.eu.org/?p=496  
Added functions such as logs and notifications (for Windows 10) on the original basis.  

## Installation & Usage
1. Make sure python is installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
4. Based on your network login system, please complete the form in the `CNART.py` file.  
   Ensure the form can be effectively submitted and logged in the network at runtime.
6. Double-click `run.bat` to start the program. If successful, the `log.txt` will be generated and updated in real time.
   The program will run in the background as `pythonw.exe` (you can check it out in the task manager) without manual intervention.  
   You can add `run.bat` to the startup task by creating a shortcut, so you don't need to start it manually in the future.
